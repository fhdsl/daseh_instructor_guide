## Motivation

The [Data Science for Environmental Health Short Course (DaSEH)](https://daseh.org/), developed at the [Fred Hutch Data Science Lab](https://hutchdatascience.org/),  is an education platform that provides open-source teaching materials using real-world examples for active experiences of introductory concepts in environmental health data analyses. The intention of this guide is to provide instructors more information about how to make the most of our resources.


## Target Audience  

This guide is intended for educators who are interested in using DaSEH materials for instruction.

Elements of our materials can be helpful for instructors who teach:

- High school students
- Undergraduate students
- Graduate students

Elements of the case studies can assist with teaching courses about the following topics:

- Environmental Health
- Data science
- Statistics
- Public health
- Programming
- Technical writing  

... and more

## Curriculum  

This guide documents:

- The DaSEH philosophy 
- The general structure of the short course
- Various entry points to using the short course materials (including our hands-on lab exercizes, homework ideas and more)
- Examples of how to use the materials in the classroom 
- Instructions on how to modify and adapt components of our materials for the classroom
- Guidelines for contributing to our materials or creating your own short course


## DaSEH Philosophy

The DaSEH short course is an educational resource that educators can use in the classroom to teach students how to effectively derive knowledge from data in real-world challenges about environmental health.

We provide independent learners and educators with resources for environmental health data science education. Most of the examples use real data from sources that are used for actual research or public health initiatives in an effort to make the material more engaging and relevant. 

Our resources are not intended to show all aspects of the research process, however they are intended to introduce beginners, demonstrate the decision making process of real data analyses, the basic challenges of analyses, to show examples of applications of data methods, and to provide context for when such methods could be applied to glean information from data. We hope to demonstrate best practices for mindful data cleaning, reproducibility, and effective data science communication. 

We emphasize learning the concepts of best practices as well as how to troubleshoot and look up documentation to support continued learning, rather than memorization of small coding details. For more information on our teaching philosophy see our [paper about teaching R](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012018).

All DaSEH materials are open source and free and available at our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/fhdsl/DaSEH). We provide transparency about where the data came from and where possible how it was produced. We also cover data method limitations and ethicalconsiderations.

Our materials can be used for small additional assignments in a classroom setting or as the main content that educators can slowly work through with students.

We hope you find our resources useful!



### What problem are we addressing?

Despite a growing interest in data science and environmental health on campuses, instructors do not always have time to create course content to support new courses. These resources are intended to help others support more environmental health data science education to promote more research and advancement in this importants field of public health. 


 
## DaSEH Short Course Resources

```

The DaSEH Short Course has 3 main stages:

  
  
### Stage 1: Online Instructions

In the first stage, learners participate in a synchronous online course where they watch didactic lectures on a particular topic, followed by hands-on lab activities. This last for two weeks. We cover the following topics.

Week one:

- Reproducibility
- Basic R
- Subsetting Data
- Summarizing Data
- Cleaning Data

Week two:

- Manipulation Data
- Visualization of Data
- Statistics
- Functions

Course instruction lasts for 4 hours each day with breaks.

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "online course schedule starting at 10:30am to 11:30 for the first session, followed by a break for 1- min then another session from 11:40 - 12:40, followed by another ten minute break, concluding with a session from 12:50 to 2 pm", out.width="100%"}
ottrpal::include_slide('https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vCiMPvvsdwQjiMWjf0YuSpTkG0DGXsy1614cRiFc7ns/edit?slide=id.g38d50c20f17_0_79#slide=id.g38d50c20f17_0_79')
```

During each session we cover one or two modules, which include didactic lectures led by an instructor and followed by hands-on lab exercises. 

We recommend having two instructors and one TA. We have the instructors split up the module lectures for the following reasons:

- to reduce instruction burden
- to allow learners the opportunity to ask chat questions during the course without slowing the rest of the course
- to allow the learners to have instructors with slightly different teaching styles/explanations

For labs we provide learners with 3 options:

- A room led by one instructor who waits briefly for each question and then walks through the exercizes
- A room led by one instructor who allows students time to work through all exercizes and then students share their work and challenges with guidance and troubleshooting from the instructor
- A room where the teaching assistant helps those who need one-on-one support

### Stage 2: Analyzing the Data 

This stage includes the bulk of the data analysis. It begins with a detailed description of the data used in the case study, how it was generated, and where is was obtained. This sets the stage for a walk-through of the data import procedure and exploration of the available data. From there, the specific subsets of the data relevant to answering the main question of interest can be identified and the data can be cleaned and wrangled to give the data in the format needed for analysis. The cleaned data can then be visualized and analyzed to answer the study question. 

- Data description
- Import and exploration 
- Wrangling 
- Visualization 
- Analysis 

### Stage 3: Wrapping-Up

In the final stage of the case study, students synthesize conclusions to the main study question based on the results of their data analysis. They summarize the data exploration and analysis steps they took and discuss potential next steps they could take based on their results. Finally, additional analyses are suggested as homework and additional information relevant to the case study is provided. 

- Analysis conclusions 
- Case study summary
- Next steps 
- Homework

## Starter Kit

Open Case Studies are designed to be beginner friendly. Users can work through an entire case study with no prerequisite knowledge in programming, public health, or statistics. However, the appropriate technology, software, and a basic familiarity with R Studio is required. This section will detail what students will need to be able to jump into a case study. 

### Technical Requirements 

All case studies use the R statistical programming language for data analysis. R is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux and can be downloaded from the [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/). While there is no specific R version requirement for the case studies, the [`OCSdata`](https://github.com/opencasestudies/OCSdata) package, which can be used to download the data, requires R version 3.5 or higher. Furthermore, R packages used to run specific analyses in each case study may have their own R version requirements. R version requirements may be checked in the Session Info section in each case study.

Cheat sheets detailing how to use common packages and functions are available at the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).  

Please note that to install R version 3.5 and higher you will need to have a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) and a compatible [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system). See this [link](https://cran.r-project.org/) for more information.

These compilation times were measured on a PC machine operating on Windows 10. The ranges listed should only be used as estimates as compilation time will vary with different machines and operating systems.

### RStudio

To work with R, we recommend the RStudio Integrated Development Environment. RStudio includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. RStudio is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) or in a browser connected to RStudio Server. More information and program installation instruction are available at the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).

For reproducible data analyses and easy publishing of reports and presentations, we recommend using RMarkdown. More information about RMarkdown is also available at the [RStudio website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html).  

### GitHub  

Open Case Studies is hosted on GitHub. GitHub is a website and cloud service that enables developers to store, manage, and track changes to their code. OCS uses GitHub for both development and distribution purposes. Users have complete access to all case study material through our [OCS GitHub page](https://github.com/opencasestudies) where each case study is hosted in an individual repository. The repository contains all the materials needed for the case study. This includes the case study text to be distributed to students, the data used in the case study (discussed below), additional documents and references, and brief guidelines on case study use. While GitHub is not needed for users to access the case studies, users can use GitHub to streamline download and modification of case studies. Check out the GitHub Organization and OCSdata sections in [Chapter 2](https://www.opencasestudies.org/OCS_Guide/open-case-study-infrastructure.html) for more details on how to use GitHub to access case studies and modify content for personalized use. An introduction on how to get started with GitHub is available at [Happy Git](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html).
