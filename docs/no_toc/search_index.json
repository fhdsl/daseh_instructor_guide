DaSEH is tailored for beginners and novices in R programming, offering instruction on importing, wrangling, visualizing, and analyzing data. It provides hands-on training in using R for statistical computing, a widely-used open-source tool for data analysis and visualization. This training initiative is funded by National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences 1R25ES035590-01. DaSEH guides can be used: As a course or to add to a curriculum (either onsite or online) by engaging students to actively participate in data science education for environmental health. Outside of the classroom by providing an archive of examples code for data science best practices for self-learning. To help guide educators on how to most effectively use the DaSEH resources (either in or outside of the classroom), this guide documents various entry points to using the materials, examples of how to use the materials, how to modify and adapt components of the resources for the classroom, and how to contribute our resources.

The intention of this guide is to provide instructors more information about how to make the most of our resources. 1.3 Target Audience This guide is intended for educators who are interested in using DaSEH materials for instruction. Elements of our materials can be helpful for instructors who teach: High school students Undergraduate students Graduate students Professionals (researchers and public health practitioners) Elements of the case studies can assist with teaching courses about the following topics: Environmental Health Data science Statistics Public health Programming Technical writing … and more 1.4 Curriculum This guide documents: The DaSEH philosophy The general structure of the short course Various entry points to using the short course materials (including our hands-on lab exercises, homework ideas and more) Examples of how to use the materials in the classroom Instructions on how to modify and adapt components of our materials for the classroom Guidelines for contributing to our materials or creating your own short course 1.5 DaSEH Philosophy The DaSEH short course is an educational resource that educators can use in the classroom to teach students how to effectively derive knowledge from data in real-world challenges about environmental health. We provide independent learners and educators with resources for environmental health data science education. Most of the examples use real data from sources that are used for actual research or public health initiatives in an effort to make the material more engaging and relevant. Our resources are not intended to show all aspects of the research process, however they are intended to introduce beginners, demonstrate the decision making process of real data analyses, the basic challenges of analyses, to show examples of applications of data methods, and to provide context for when such methods could be applied to glean information from data. We hope to demonstrate best practices for mindful data cleaning, reproducibility, and effective data science communication. We emphasize learning the concepts of best practices as well as how to troubleshoot and look up documentation to support continued learning, rather than memorization of small coding details. For more information on our teaching philosophy see our paper about teaching R. All DaSEH materials are open source and free and available at our GitHub Repository. We provide transparency about where the data came from and where possible how it was produced. We also cover data method limitations and ethical considerations. Our materials can be used for small additional assignments in a classroom setting or as the main content that educators can slowly work through with students. We hope you find our resources useful! 1.5.1 What problem are we addressing? Despite a growing interest in data science and environmental health on campuses, instructors do not always have time to create course content to support new courses. These resources are intended to help others support more environmental health data science education to promote more research and advancement in this important field of public health. 1.6 DaSEH Short Course Resources The DaSEH Short Course has 3 main stages: 1.6.1 Stage 1: Online Instructions In the first stage, learners participate in a synchronous online course where they watch didactic lectures on a particular topic, followed by hands-on lab activities. This last for two weeks. We cover the following topics. Week one: Reproducibility Basic R Subsetting Data Summarizing Data Cleaning Data Week two: Manipulation Data Visualization of Data Statistics Functions Course instruction lasts for 4 hours each day with breaks. During each session we cover one or two modules, which include didactic lectures led by an instructor and followed by hands-on lab exercises. We recommend having two instructors and one TA. We have the instructors split up the module lectures for the following reasons: to reduce instruction burden to allow learners the opportunity to ask chat questions during the course without slowing the rest of the course to allow the learners to have instructors with slightly different teaching styles/explanations For labs we provide learners with 3 options: A room led by one instructor who waits briefly for each question and then walks through the exercises A room led by one instructor who allows students time to work through all exercises and then students share their work and challenges with guidance and troubleshooting from the instructor A room where the teaching assistant helps those who need one-on-one support Topics covered in each week of the online course: Students have access to our website for course resources which includes lecture slides, lab exercises, cheatsheets to remind them about important functions, homework assignments, and additional resources. 1.6.2 Stage 2: Self-Directed Review and Project Planning In this stage, learners can complete homework problems for extra practice or watch recordings of the lectures and labs from the previous week. This stage also lasts at least a week. It also gives students time to digest what they learned and catch up on other work and personal responsibilities before the code-a-thon. Learners are also encouraged to find data and are given resources on where one can find public data, so that they can identify a research question for their project in the code-a-thon stage. Learners are provided with an example project and a project template R Markdown file. 1.6.3 Stage 3: Code-a-thon In the final stage of the short course, learners participate in a 3 day code-a-thon, which allows them to apply what they learned to a topic of interest, get peer and instructor in person assistance, ask more extensive questions, and learn about some more advanced topics in reproducibility and data ethics. See this code-a-thon schedule for more details. 1.7 Getting Started DaSEH materials are designed to be beginner friendly. Users can work through our materials with no prerequisite knowledge in programming, environmental health, public health, or statistics. However, the appropriate technology, software, and a basic familiarity with R Studio is helpful. This section will detail what learners and instructors will need to be able to jump into our resources. 1.7.1 Technical Requirements Our materials the R statistical programming language for data analysis. R is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux and can be downloaded from the The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). While there is no specific R version requirement, we recommend that instructors have all students use the same version (typically the most recent version of R). Additional R packages are also required including: tidyverse naniar janitor esquisse Cheatsheets detailing how to use common packages and functions are available at the RStudio website. Please note that to install R version 3.5 and higher you will need to have a web browser and a compatible operating system. See this link for more information. 1.7.2 RStudio To work with R, we recommend the RStudio Integrated Development Environment. RStudio includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. RStudio is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) or in a browser connected to RStudio Server. More information and program installation instruction are available at the RStudio website. For reproducible data analyses and easy publishing of reports and presentations, we recommend using RMarkdown. More information about RMarkdown is also available at the RStudio website. 1.7.3 GitHub DaSEH is hosted on GitHub. GitHub is a website and cloud service that enables developers to store, manage, and track changes to their code. DaSEH uses GitHub for both development and distribution purposes. Users have complete access to all materials through our DaSEH GitHub repository. The repository contains all the materials needed for the case study. This includes the slide files to be distributed to learners, data used in the examples (that aren’t installed in R otherwise), cheatsheets to remind learners of packages, homework and lab files, including both keys and raw files for learners. While experience with GitHub is not needed for users to access the materials, users can use GitHub to streamline download and modification of our resources.

We would greatly appreciate you filling it out if you have the time! 2.2.4 Materials We have the following modules on various topics related to data science for environmental public health. Each one has lecture slides built using ioslides and as well as lab activities built using R Markdown. The rendered version of the slides, as well as the raw Rmd file are available on the website or our GitHub repository. In addition, the rendered and raw versions of the both the lab and the lab key are also available. We also include cheatsheets so that learners can review the functions that they learned that day. An Introduction to R This module includes the history of how R came to be and how it differs from other options like Python or Stata. It also includes how students should anticipate the experience of learning in the course and suggestions for how to learn. It also introduces jargon such as variable, row, column, object. This module does not have a lab associated with it. Basic R This module includes how to assign objects, how to create vectors, and how to perform simple calculations. The lab activity which is just an html webpage (as learners are not yet introduced to Rmd files) involves performing simple mathematical operations, assigning vectors, and checking the class and length of vectors. RStudio This module includes a tour of RStudio, how to write code that can be saved or how to write interactive code, for instance for installing a package where the user may have to answer questions. The lab activity involves knitting the Rmd file, running code chunks in the Rmd file, running all previous chunks, creating new chunks, and adding headers. Reproducibility This module introduces concepts related to repeatability, reproducibility, and replicability. It introduces best practices for improving transparency in our code. The lab activity features tasks like cleaning the environment, using the set.seed() function to generate the same random numbers each time, and using the sessionInfo() function to list packages and versions used. Data Input This module describes how to import data using point-and-click methods within RStudio as well as through using functions of the readr package. We cover import of csv files and other delimited files like tab delimited files, as well as tools for importing excel files and SAS, SPSS, and Stata files. We also cover methods for checking your imported data. The lab activity covers using the point-and-click option within RStudio and using code with readr. Data Subsetting This module includes information about how to access specific parts of our data that we are interested including using options to select for specific columns or filter for specific rows. In doing so we cover and and or logic for applying conditions for filtering. We also cover renaming columns (using rename from the dplyr package and clean_names from the janitor package) and best practices for naming columns, as this can impact our ability to subset our data. We also discuss why pulling the data withing a column of a data frame as a vector is often needed for mathematical operations. In addition we cover how to arrange data based on a specific order of interest, how to remove columns, and how to create columns using the mutate() function. The lab activity covers functions like rename(), rename_with(), pull(), select(), filter() so that learners can practice renaming columns, pulling out the vector version of columns, selecting specific columns, and filtering data based on thresholds or other conditions of specific columns. Learners also practice creating new columns with mutate(). Data Summarization This module covers how to apply mathematical functions to get summary statistics from data including, mean, standard deviation, range, max, and min. We show how we can pull the data out as a vector to use these functions or we can use the summarize() function on columns of a data to create a new data frame with summary statistics. We also talk about the summary() function to find quantiles of data quickly. In the lab activity, learners find the dimensions of the data, use the count function to summarize the data, use pull and mathematical functions like sum to calculate summaries of columns, as well as use the summarize() function to summarize the data. Data Cleaning This module covers how to find and work with missing data using the naniar package and count, how to recode missing data or recode data as NA, how to recode specific values of a column or create a new column based on conditions of other columns using the case_when() function. We also cover how to separate or unite columns and how to use stringr functions to help modify values or find specific values based on patterns within the values as opposed to perfect matches. In the lab activity, learners evaluate the missing data within a dataset and recode data within a dataset that has many different values for the same measurement. For example, “n, N, and”No” to indicate no exposure. Manipulating Data This module covers how to rearrange data so that it is either in long or wide format. We discuss how wide format can be useful for human interpretation and how long format is useful for R to use the data for analyses and data visualizations. We also discuss how to join different datasets together and describe why one might want to do this. In the lab activity, learners use functions like pivot_longer and pivot_wider to change the shape of a dataset. They also practice doing joins of datasets together and comparing how the different joining functions work. Intro to Data Visualization This module gives learners a taste of making data visualizations by using the point-and-click option of the esquisse package so that learners can quickly attempt data visualizations and get the code for generating such visualizations. In the lab activity, learners get to try out creating different plots with esquisse. Data Visualization This module dives deeper into best practices for data visualization, how to make a ggplot2 plot, and more customization options for creating data visualizations such as using themes, how to spot common issues in visualizations and fix them, as well as how to make plots interactive or how to combine plots using other packages like plotly and patchwork. In the lab activity, learners practice making plots directly with ggplot2 and practice applying new themes to their plots and faceting their plots. Factors In this module learners discover why factors are a unique type of data that requires special care to make summaries, data analysis results, and visualizations show data in the proper order. We show how to use the forecats package to reorder a factor variable based on the values of another variable. In the lab activity, learners convert a variable to a factor class and specify new levels for the variable. They also discover how this changes the order of the variable values within data summaries and plots, as compared to the data just being a categorical variable instead of a factor. Statistics In this module, we describe how statistical tests like t-tests, correlation, and regression are performed within R. We do not focus on the statistical interpretation, but rather how one can use R tools to perform statistical test and get the results. In the lab activity, learners perform a correlation test between two vectors, perform a t-test, and perform regressions (including a logistic regression). Data Output In this module, learners discover that they can save their processed data as RDS (R native) or csv files so that they don’t have to rerun processing on data (especially if it is large) or if they want to share data with others. In the lab activity, learners write a csv and RDS file as well as read back in an RDS file. Functions In this final module, learners discover the power of writing their own functions. They also learn about using the apply functions and across() function to apply the same function across different columns within a data frame. We discuss why using less repetitive code can improve the quality and efficiency of their code. In the lab activity, learners create their own simple functions and use the across function to summarize different columns of a dataset, as well as apply a new function on the specific columns of dataset. 2.3 DaSEH GitHub Organization GitHub is a website and cloud service that enables developers to store, manage, and track changes to their code. DaSEH uses GitHub for both development and distribution purposes. Users have complete access to all DaSEH course materials at our course and website repository.

We will give a information on what material is appropriate for beginner, intermediate, or advanced learners. We will describe ways that instructors can use the full set of DaSEH resources, some of the modules, or just the data. We will present some examples of extensions that can accompany the materials and can serve as a template for homework assignments or independent student exploration. The examples presented in this chapter are merely suggestions - modifications to the material to fit student needs are expected and encouraged! If you come up with a different way to use our resources, please [let us know]https://daseh.org/contact.html) what you come up with so that other educators may be inspired by your creativity. 3.1.1 Prerequisites 3.1.1.1 Environmental Health Subject Matter The materials in DaSEH use data related to environmental health. There is no requirement for any prior knowledge on environmental health. The resources are also applicable for those interested in data science for other uses. 3.1.1.2 Statistics The DaSEH materials do expect some familiarity with statistics and focuses mostly on the application of R for analysis, rather than the theory of statistics. We recommend additional resources for statistics if you are teaching a statistics course. 3.1.1.3 Coding/Data Science All materials for DaSEH use the R statistical programming language for data analysis. No familiarity with R basics is expected for learners. 3.1.1.4 Software All case studies use the R statistical programming language for data analysis. While there is no specific R version requirement for the case studies, the OCSdata package, which can be used to get and load the data, does require R 3.5. Furthermore, R packages used to run specific analyses in each case study may have their own R version requirements. R version requirements may be checked in the sessionInfo() section in each case study. 3.1.2 Experience Level Descriptions The table below explains how we define the beginner, intermediate, and advanced experience levels. Experience Level Description Beginner Little to no previous experience with coding and/or statistical analysis. Intermediate Familiar with at least one programming language and has experience working with data and statistics. Advanced Fluent in at least one programming language and likely familiar with more. Has a depth of experience working with data science projects. Typically, most middle/high school and first year undergraduate students will fit in the beginner category. Upperclassmen undergraduates and some graduate students are often at the intermediate level. Most advanced level students will be at the graduate level. However, this is a generalization, and a student may be considered beginner, intermediate, or advanced at any academic level depending on their independent studies and experiences. 3.2 DaSEH in the Classroom The DaSEH materials are structured in a modular manner to support both partial and full use of our materials. Educators are also free to use the DaSEH data by itself. 3.2.1 Teaching the full set of materials The DaSEH materials are written to provide a comprehensive introduction to enviornmental health data science. Our materials provide students with experience in all the standard aspects of a data science workflow as well as best practices regarding reproducibility. The following list provides a few examples of how educators could use the mateirals: Use our full set of slides as lecture and materials as we have used them Do a flipped classroom approach and assigned students to read the slides as homework and do labs in the class together Assign students to extend analysis beyond what is shown in our lecture or lab materials to dive deeper or provide more homework 3.2.1.1 Duration DaSEH was designed to fit the duration of an intensive two week short course for 3.5 hours a day for roughly 32 hours of instruction time. However, the materials could also be spread out to fit a semester 16 week long course. 3.2.2 Teaching Part of the DaSEH Materials Some educators may find that only certain modules are relevant to their course learning objectives. Each provides information about how to access the appropriate data. Note that you may have to add some introduction to explain any functions that were explained in a previous module. For a data visualization course, the following modules could be helpful: Basic R (only if students don’t have familiarity with R) RStudio (only if students don’t have familiarity with R) Manipulating Data in R (to convert data from wide to long format to facilitate data visualization) Intro to Data Visualization Data Visualization Factors For a data wrangling course, the following modules could be helpful: Basic R RStudio (only if students don’t have familiarity with R) Subsetting Data in R Data Classes Data Cleaning Manipulating Data in R Factors For a reproducibility course the following modules could be 3.2.3 Teaching With Case Study Data Only Educators can use the data available with the case studies without using the case study as a whole. The data is available on GitHub and can be accessed using the OCSdata R package. 3.3 Case Study Recommendations Each case study demonstrates an entire data analysis starting from data import and wrangling and continuing to statistical analysis and data visualization. This means that individual case studies can often incorporate different skill levels for different stages of the analyses. For example, a case study can use advanced data wrangling approaches but only need beginner level statistical analysis methods. Below we provide broad categorizations of each of the case studies in terms of the skill levels required (beginner, intermediate, or advanced) for each of the general stages of the case studies (data wrangling, data visualization, and statistics). More details on the specific skills taught in each case study can be found in the Case Study Search Tool or in the Learning Objectives section in each case study. Here, we are using the following interpretations of “beginner”, “intermediate”, and “advanced”: Skill Level Data Import Data Wrangling Data Visualization Statistics Beginner No experience with importing data into any programming language No experience wrangling and cleaning raw data in any programming language No experience visualizing data in any programming language No experience with statistical concepts Intermediate Some experience with importing common data formats (e.g. CSVs) into R or significant experience in another programming language Some experience wrangling or cleaning raw data in common formats (e.g. numerical data) in R or significant experience in another programming language Some experience with common visualization packages in R (e.g. ggplot) or significant experience in another programming language Some familiarity with common statistical concepts (e.g. summary statistics, hypothesis testing) and techniques (e.g. t-test) Advanced Experience with importing uncommon data types (e.g. PDFs or web-scraping) and comfort with troubleshooting import challenges Experience cleaning and wrangling raw data in uncommon formats (e.g. regular expressions) in R and comfort with troubleshooting wrangling challenges Experience with creating complex data visualizations in R and comfort with visualization challenges Good understanding of foundational statistical concepts and comfort with applying foundational statistical techniques The following table lists a few example case studies that would be suitable for each experience level. Case Study Data Import Data Wrangling Data Visualization Statistics School Shootings in the United States Intermediate Beginner Advanced Beginner Disparities in Youth Disconnection Intermediate Beginner Beginner Beginner Opioids in United States Intermediate Beginner Beginner Intermediate Vaping Behaviors in American Youth Beginner Beginner Beginner Intermediate Mental Health of American Youth Advanced Beginner Beginner Beginner Exploring global patterns of obesity across rural and urban regions Intermediate Beginner Beginner Beginner Influence of Multicollinearity on Measured Impact of Right-to-Carry Gun Laws - Part 1 Beginner Advanced NA NA Influence of Multicollinearity on Measured Impact of Right-to-Carry Gun Laws - Part 2 NA NA Intermediate Advanced Exploring CO2 emissions across time Beginner Beginner Beginner Beginner Exploring global patterns of dietary behaviors associated with health risk Intermediate Intermediate Intermediate Intermediate Predicting Annual Air Pollution Beginner Beginner Intermediate Advanced Exploring health expenditure using state-level data in the United States Beginner Beginner Beginner Beginner 3.4 Troubleshooting You may encounter errors trying to render our case studies. In which case, we suggest that you check the “Session Info” section under the “Additional Information”section of the case study to see what versions of packages we used. R packages versions can have updates to arguments and function names that can cause code to work differently or can break the code. If you encounter an error, this is likely the reason. We try to update our case studies when we can, but we can’t always update the information in a timely manner as this is currently a passion project. You can either use the error message from trying to knit the case study to determine what function may have been updated or deprecated (we recommend this option to help you or your students learn the most up-to-date information), or you can use the versions of the packages that are shown in our Session Info section and load the versions that we used, following the directions here. 3.5 Example Use Cases Because the case studies were developed to be modular and stand-alone, they can be used in a variety of ways that cater to the learner’s goals, experience, and interests. Below, we provide a few examples of how case studies have been used previously. If you use Open Case Studies in a new way, we would love to hear about it! 3.5.1 Using Case Studies as Lecture Content Practical Data Science in R is a 10-week intermediate undergraduate course taught by Dr. Shannon Ellis at University of California Santa Barbara. In 2021, Dr. Ellis taught the course using three Open Case Studies and used them to illustrate how foundational data science skills and statistical concepts taught throughout the course can be applied to real data. Here you can see how the course used the OCSdata package: Dr. Ellis incorporated labs and homework assignments into the course, which had guided coding and analysis exercises related to the concepts discussed in lecture which used content from the case studies in a slide format. She also assigned written reports where students presented the analysis they conducted related to the case study in the format of a scientific article (see example assignment below). 3.5.2 Using Case Studies for Assignments Advanced Data Science was a semester-long graduate data science course taught by Dr. Jeff Leek and Dr. Roger Peng in 2020 at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, primarily for PhD students. This course is designed for students to gain experience in designing and communicating data analyses effectively and critically analyzing analyses. Assignments included writing scientific journal sections (e.g. Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) based on the case studies and extending analyses based on results presented in the case study. 3.5.3 Independent Study Case studies can be used for learners to gain experience in statistics and data science independently. We strongly recommend that independent learners aim to actively engage with the case study by running the analyses independently, exploring the data beyond what is presented in the case study, and extending the analyses by to investigate their own hypotheses. Furthermore, creating a finished product, such as a blog post or a presentation, can be an excellent demonstration of the skills learned. 3.5.4 Interactive Case Studies Some of the case studies also have interactive versions. These versions allow students to write and run code in the browser interactively, with hints and answers available for students to check their progress as they go through the case study. Interactive case studies could be appropriate for independent learning or for in class labs, as they provide real time feedback and can reduce demands on the educator to provide intensive personalized feedback. Please see the following video for a demonstration on how to use the interactive case studies: 3.6 Examples of assignments Educators are not limited to having the students go through the case study in their current format. Case studies can be a spring board for further exploration and additional assignments. For example, in addition to helping students develop data analysis skills, we hope that the case studies can also help students develop their curiosity, technical writing and communication skills. Additional assignments can include but is not limited to data visualization and presentation, written reports, and oral presentations. Below we provide a few examples of potential assignments that educators can use to tailor instruction to the desired learning objectives. See here guidelines about considerations for effective and ethical data visualizations from the Advanced Data Science Course taught by Jeff leek and Roger Peng at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 3.6.1 Written Report Below is an example of a scientific-style paper written based on the Opioid Use Case Study. We also include an example rubric by which this paper can be evaluated adapted from here. OCS Opioid Use in the US Example Report OCS Opioid Use in the US Example Report Rubric 3.6.2 Oral Presentation Below is an example of a presentation based on the Vaping Behaviors in American Youth Case Study. This presentation focuses on the context of the study and the methods used in the analysis. Assignments for presentations can be modified to emphasize presenting results and conclusions or to emphasize communication to different audiences (e.g. policy makers, other researchers, the public, etc. ). OCS Vaping Case Study Oral Presentation Assignment Example OCS Vaping Case Study Oral Presentation Example 3.6.3 Data Visualization The data visualizations included in the case studies are not the only way to present the data used within the analyses. While the principles of effective data visualization are a focus of the case studies, the data included as well as the study questions can be used to guide students through the design choices that are commonly considered when determining how to best present data. Students can be assigned to create a new visualization beyond what is included in the case studies that emphasizes different aspects in the data. 3.6.4 Further Exploration Several case studies have additional data that is not discussed. This can be used for further exploration of the subject area that was discussed in the case study. This can be guided by the questions included in the Homework section of the case studies. Case studies that have additional data include the Opioid Use Case Study, the Right to Carry Case Study, and the CO2 Emissions Case Study. Below is an example of an assignment assigned to students in the Advanced Data Science Course at Johns Hopkins. In this assignment students were asked to create a simpler machine learning analysis based on the case study. They were also asked to share their analysis with another student and write a summary and critique of the other student’s analysis. This provides an opportunity for the student to try out analysis skills with their own analysis work, and also work on their comprehension skills of reading other people’s work. It also shows how we can get different results with minor changes in our analyses.: OCS Air Pollution Extension Assignment Example Acknowledgments We would like to thank the following people for generously sharing the ways in which they used Open Case Studies materials in their teaching: Dr. Shannon Ellis Dr. Jeff Leek Dr. Roger Peng 3.7 Session info ## R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libblas.so.3 ## LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.20.so; LAPACK version 3.10.0 ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8 ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## time zone: Etc/UTC ## tzcode source: system (glibc) ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] jsonlite_2.0.0 dplyr_1.1.4 compiler_4.3.2 gitcreds_0.1.2 ## [5] promises_1.2.1 tidyselect_1.2.0 Rcpp_1.0.12 xml2_1.5.1 ## [9] webshot2_0.1.2 stringr_1.5.1 jquerylib_0.1.4 later_1.3.2 ## [13] tidyr_1.3.1 yaml_2.3.12 fastmap_1.1.1 readr_2.1.5 ## [17] R6_2.6.1 generics_0.1.3 knitr_1.50 tibble_3.3.0 ## [21] bookdown_0.46 rprojroot_2.1.1 bslib_0.6.1 pillar_1.9.0 ## [25] tzdb_0.4.0 rlang_1.1.6 utf8_1.2.4 websocket_1.4.4 ## [29] cachem_1.0.8 stringi_1.8.3 xfun_0.55 sass_0.4.8 ## [33] cli_3.6.5 magrittr_2.0.3 ps_1.9.1 digest_0.6.34 ## [37] rvest_1.0.5 processx_3.8.6 hms_1.1.3 lifecycle_1.0.4 ## [41] chromote_0.5.1 vctrs_0.6.5 ottrpal_2.0.0 evaluate_1.0.5 ## [45] glue_1.7.0 spelling_2.3.2 fansi_1.0.6 rmarkdown_2.25 ## [49] purrr_1.0.2 httr_1.4.7 htmltools_0.5.7 tools_4.3.2 ## [53] pkgconfig_2.0.3 "],["modifying-open-case-studies.html", "Chapter 4 Modifying open case studies 4.1 Learning Objectives 4.2 Modular use 4.3 Modify a case study 4.4 Session info", " Chapter 4 Modifying open case studies 4.1 Learning Objectives This chapter will cover how to modify the case studies to your own needs using the following methods: Modular case study use with the help of the OCSdata package Modifying a case study with GitHub and RStudio 4.2 Modular use Some educators may find that only certain sections of a case study are relevant to their specific needs. For example, a statistics teacher may want students to practice the skills covered in the data analysis section, but doesn’t have time to go through the whole case study. The case studies are designed to allow for such use. This educator and their students may jump right in to any case study section without working through any previous sections. This is made possible because the data files are saved at the end of each section. These data files are made available on the case study’s GitHub repository and may also be downloaded with the help of the OCSdata package. See Chapter 2 for more details on the structure and organization of a case study data folder. The table below explains which data sub-folder and package function to use for each case study section. Data Folder Case Study Section OCSdata Function raw Data Import raw_data imported Data Exploration, Data Wrangling imported_data wrangled Data Visualization, Data Analysis wrangled_csv, wrangled_rda simpler_import Data Import simpler_import_data extra Suggested Homework (?) extra_data If you’d like to learn more about modular use of Open Case Studies you can read this thesis by former graduate student Michael Breshock (breshock_expanding_2021?). 4.2.1 Example of Modular Use The following steps illustrate how one would skip to a specific case study section. The data analysis section from the “Opioids in United States” case study is used for this example, but these directions apply for any section in any case study. 4.2.1.1 Steps for modular use Use the table of contents to navigate to the section of interest. Click on the arrow that reads “If you skipped the previous sections click here.” Follow the instructions provided to download the data files from the previous section either with OCSdata or manually through GitHub. We will now demonstrate each option. 4.2.1.2 Downloading data with OCSdata: First install and load the OCSdata package: Now download the wrangled data into your R environment using the following function command: This command will download the wrangled data in .RDA format. You may also be downloaded wrangled data in .CSV format by replacing ‘wrangled_rda’ with ‘wrangled_csv’ Load the RDA files with the following commands: 4.2.1.3 Manually Download Data from GitHub: Download the .RDA files available on the case study GitHub repository from here. The CSV versions of the files may also be downloaded here, if preferred Move the data files from your ‘Downloads’ folder to your R session’s current working directory (you can see what this is with getwd()). Load the RDA files with the following commands: All the data you need to work through the current section is now loaded into your environment. You are ready to work through the section of interest, without needing to work through any of the previous sections. 4.3 Modify a case study The case studies are written in R Markdown documents and developed within an RStudio project. R Markdown documents are denoted with the file extension “.Rmd” and allow for the inclusion of code chunks and outputs in a written report. They are written using Markdown syntax. RStudio projects are used to organize the case studies. The knitr package “knits” the case study written in R Markdown and outputs the document as an HTML file. Open Case Studies uses these HTML files to post the case studies online. The entire case study project is contained in a GitHub repository which allows for easy distribution and version control. GitHub Pages is used to host the case study webpage from the case study repository. Modifying a case study requires the following simple steps: Use the OCSdata package zip_ocs() function to download the case study files without our git history. Alternatively, if you are familiar with GitHub and wish to you can clone or fork the case study repository from GitHub. See this section of chapter 2 for more information. In the repository folder, open the case study .Rproj file to open the project up in RStudio. Edit the sections to be modified in the index.Rmd file. Save your changes, then click on the “Knit” drop down menu in the top left corner of RStudio. Choose which file format you’d like to knit to. Distribute your modified case study as you please! You can share HTML, PDF and Word files directly with your students or you can host your case study for free on GitHub using GitHub pages (pages_github?). To do so, you will need to set up your version of the case study on GitHub. If you are new to GitHub, also be sure to check out (happygitwithr?). These steps are demonstrated in the following video about modifying case studies: 4.4 Session info ## R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libblas.so.3 ## LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.20.so; LAPACK version 3.10.0 ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8 ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## time zone: Etc/UTC ## tzcode source: system (glibc) ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] jsonlite_2.0.0 dplyr_1.1.4 compiler_4.3.2 gitcreds_0.1.2 ## [5] promises_1.2.1 tidyselect_1.2.0 Rcpp_1.0.12 xml2_1.5.1 ## [9] webshot2_0.1.2 stringr_1.5.1 jquerylib_0.1.4 later_1.3.2 ## [13] tidyr_1.3.1 yaml_2.3.12 fastmap_1.1.1 readr_2.1.5 ## [17] R6_2.6.1 generics_0.1.3 knitr_1.50 tibble_3.3.0 ## [21] bookdown_0.46 rprojroot_2.1.1 bslib_0.6.1 pillar_1.9.0 ## [25] tzdb_0.4.0 rlang_1.1.6 utf8_1.2.4 websocket_1.4.4 ## [29] cachem_1.0.8 stringi_1.8.3 xfun_0.55 sass_0.4.8 ## [33] cli_3.6.5 magrittr_2.0.3 ps_1.9.1 digest_0.6.34 ## [37] rvest_1.0.5 processx_3.8.6 hms_1.1.3 lifecycle_1.0.4 ## [41] chromote_0.5.1 vctrs_0.6.5 ottrpal_2.0.0 evaluate_1.0.5 ## [45] glue_1.7.0 spelling_2.3.2 fansi_1.0.6 rmarkdown_2.25 ## [49] purrr_1.0.2 httr_1.4.7 htmltools_0.5.7 tools_4.3.2 ## [53] pkgconfig_2.0.3 "],["new-case-studies---building-and-contributing.html", "Chapter 5 New Case Studies - Building and Contributing 5.1 Learning Objectives 5.2 Create a Case Study 5.3 Case Study Libraries 5.4 Submission Process 5.5 Offical Case Study Guidelines 5.6 Session info", " Chapter 5 New Case Studies - Building and Contributing 5.1 Learning Objectives In this chapter we will discuss: - Creating your own case study with our template - The guidelines for how to publish your own case studies as part of our project 5.2 Create a Case Study 5.2.1 Template Case Study A template case study is available in a repository on our GitHub page at github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-template. This template contains the basic skeletal structure used for our case studies. Creating a new case study with the template is very similar to modifying an existing case study: Click on the “use this template” button at opencasestudies/ocs-bp-template. Open the index.Rmd file in RStudio. Add the case study content to the index.Rmd file. Use the instructions provided in this file to add different elements such as images and videos. Save your changes and knit the case study to the preferred file format. Distribute the knitted case study as you please! All of these steps are demonstrated in the following video: If you’d like to learn more about MakeCaseStudies, you can read this thesis by former graduate student Michael Breshock (breshock_expanding_2021?). 5.3 Case Study Libraries To help curate case studies for educators and learners, we would like to encourage others to help us expand our library of case studies. We recognize that other educators may have case studies in various stages of development that could be helpful to others. We hope to facilitate sharing of these case studies on the Open Case Studies project. However, we unfortunately do not have the resources or time to help integrate all case studies we receive into the official Open Case Studies library For this reason, we have outlined the following two modes of submission: Submissions for integration into the official library: With this submission type, the Open Case Studies team will work with you starting from a case study idea through development and peer review stages, with the ultimate goal of adding your case study to the Open Case Studies project. Please note that we will only be able to accept one or two case studies a year to the official repository, as we are currently doing this as a passion project and have limited time to review and collaborate on the case studies. Please note that it is not required that case studies explore a public health topic, instead the just need to explore an interesting and timely problem. Submissions for a publicly available community repository: We hope to also create a more casual community library that allows others to share their work more easily and quickly. This repository will contain case studies submitted by educators but not included in the official Open Case Studies project library. The submission process is much simpler. Please note that case studies submitted to either collection need to be open source and with a license that permits sharing of derivatives to allow other educators to make use of our case studies as needed. The original others will retain the rights of their case studies, but need to provide citation information for others to attribute their case studies. For official case studies, the OCS team may help modify the case study and may therefore be included as authors. 5.4 Submission Process The process of submitting community case studies, involves filling out a simple form. The process of submitting to our official library involves ensuring that your case study meets our more lengthy requirements and a review process. Now we will describe the submission process for each library 5.4.1 Community Library Submissions These case studies will be shared publicly on the Open Case Studies Community Repository for the benefit of other educators and learners, with minimal review from the Open Case Studies team. To submit a case study to the Community Repository, please fill out the form below: Open Case Studies Community Repository Submission Form 5.4.2 Official Library Submissions If you have not yet created a case study, but want to create one for our official library, please complete the form below to contact the Open Case Studies team regarding a new case study idea. The team will get back to do as soon as we can. Open Case Studies New Idea Offical Repository Submission Form Ultimately your case study will be submitted using an issue template to the GitHub repository for this guide, located at this link. The form indicates what is required for case studies to be considered for inclusion in our official collection, including peer review. We will now also describe some of these requirements in more depth in the next section. 5.5 Offical Case Study Guidelines To ensure that the submitted case studies provide the most benefit to the community, we hope that they adhere as much as possible to the core structure and ideas of the Open Case Studies project. We provide the guidelines detailed below for submission to the official library. Furthermore, because the Open Case Studies team does not have the infrastructure to perform a full content review of submitted case studies, we ask that you find at least two independent reviewers to comment about the validity of the content and conclusions presented in your case study. Programming language: Case studies should be written in open source programming languages (such as R or python). Data: Case studies should use data that is publicly available or can be made publicly available. Please ensure that you are allowed to make the data public if it is not already. Transparent descriptions of data sources and how data was generated should be included when possible. Core sections: all case studies should include the following sections consistent with the published case studies. See Chapter 1, Case Study Anatomy for a detailed description on what each section should include: Getting Started: Case study context, Study motivation, Main question, Learning objectives, Study limitations. This section will outline previous literature and overarching questions in the field that make this case study question important, providing motivation for conducting the analysis in the case study. It will specify the exact question that the case study endeavors to address as well as the defining the statistical and data analysis learning objectives for the case study. It will also discuss the limitations of the investigation that may prevent the analysis from answering the main question of interest. Analyzing the Data: Data description, Import and exploration, Wrangling, Visualization, Analysis. This section includes the bulk of the data analysis, beginning with a detailed description of the data used in the case study, how it was generated, and where it was obtained. Then it walks through, step-by-step, the data import, exploration, wrangling, procedures. Finally, it demonstrates the visualization and statistical analysis steps used to address the case study question. Wrapping-up: Analysis conclusions, Case study summary, Next steps, Homework, Additional information. This section synthesized conclusions to the main study question based on the data analysis results demonstrated in the previous sections. It summarizes the analysis steps and potential next steps for further exploration, which can be suggested as homework. If applicable, additional information relevant to further study can be provided here. Content: Despite often being motivated by articles, case studies are not intended to demonstrate the methods of a paper - they are intended as an educational resource where users are guided through the data science process. Links to literature or other sources to motivate the scientific topic of the case study should be included where possible. Case studies should aim to describe the decision making process involved in performing data science related tasks. Attribution: all outside resources used in the case study should be referenced appropriately. Case studies should include disclaimers and appropriate license agreements. All included images (that are not original to the case study) should include relevant sources. Data: All data files should be saved in a folder named “data” within the project directory. All files should be contained in a sub-folder using the design scheme outlined in this diagram: This diagram is from former graduate student Michael Breshock’s thesis on the Open Case Studies. In this thesis you can find a detailed description on the organization and structure of the case study data files (breshock_expanding_2021?). The data folder is required to have at least raw, imported, and wrangled data files. This allows users to skip sections when convenient. The raw data folder consists of data files as they came from the source. These are used at the beginning of the case study analysis at the Data Import section. Imported data is the version of the data after it has already been imported into R. These should be in the form of R Data files (extensions include .RData, .Rda, and .Rds). To create these files, use the save() function in R after importing the raw data. Wrangled data is the version of the data after it has been cleaned and is ready for analysis. Use the save() function in R after wrangling the data to create these files. This data should be provided in both RDA and CSV format. The next two data sub-folders are optional and used as needed: If the raw data files for your case study come in a format that requires a complicated data import process (such as web scraping) you may consider providing the raw data in an import friendly format such as CSV or XLS(X). Place these files in the “simpler_import” sub-folder. If there are any raw data files from your source that are not used in the case study analysis, but could be analyzed in a similar fashion, please include these in the “extra” sub-folder. 5.6 Session info ##
