DaSEH is tailored for beginners and novices in R programming, offering instruction on importing, wrangling, visualizing, and analyzing data. It provides hands-on training in using R for statistical computing, a widely-used open-source tool for data analysis and visualization. This training initiative is funded by National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences 1R25ES035590-01. DaSEH resources can be used: As a course or to add to a curriculum (either onsite or online) by engaging students to actively participate in data science education for environmental health. Outside of the classroom by providing an archive of examples code for data science best practices for self-learning. To help guide educators on how to most effectively use the DaSEH resources (either in or outside of the classroom), this guide documents various entry points to using the materials, examples of how to use the materials, how to modify and adapt components of the resources for the classroom, and how to contribute our resources.

The intention of this guide is to provide instructors more information about how to make the most of our resources. 1.3 Target Audience This guide is intended for educators who are interested in using DaSEH materials for instruction. Elements of our materials can be helpful for instructors who teach: High school students Undergraduate students Graduate students Professionals (researchers and public health practitioners) Elements of the case studies can assist with teaching courses about the following topics: Environmental Health Data science Statistics Public health Programming Technical writing … and more 1.4 Curriculum This guide documents: The DaSEH philosophy The general structure of the short course Various entry points to using the short course materials (including our hands-on lab exercises, homework ideas and more) Examples of how to use the materials in the classroom Instructions on how to modify and adapt components of our materials for the classroom Guidelines for contributing to our materials or creating your own short course 1.5 DaSEH Philosophy The DaSEH short course is an educational resource that educators can use in the classroom to teach students how to effectively derive knowledge from data in real-world challenges about environmental health. We provide independent learners and educators with resources for environmental health data science education. Most of the examples use real data from sources that are used for actual research or public health initiatives in an effort to make the material more engaging and relevant. Our resources are not intended to show all aspects of the research process, however they are intended to introduce beginners, demonstrate the decision making process of real data analyses, the basic challenges of analyses, to show examples of applications of data methods, and to provide context for when such methods could be applied to glean information from data. We hope to demonstrate best practices for mindful data cleaning, reproducibility, and effective data science communication. We emphasize learning the concepts of best practices as well as how to troubleshoot and look up documentation to support continued learning, rather than memorization of small coding details. For more information on our teaching philosophy see our paper about teaching R. All DaSEH materials are open source and free and available at our GitHub Repository. We provide transparency about where the data came from and where possible how it was produced. We also cover data method limitations and ethical considerations. Our materials can be used for small additional assignments in a classroom setting or as the main content that educators can slowly work through with students. We hope you find our resources useful! 1.5.1 What problem are we addressing? Despite a growing interest in data science and environmental health on campuses, instructors do not always have time to create course content to support new courses. These resources are intended to help others support more environmental health data science education to promote more research and advancement in this important field of public health. 1.6 DaSEH Short Course Resources The DaSEH Short Course has 3 main stages: 1.6.1 Stage 1: Online Instructions In the first stage, learners participate in a synchronous online course where they watch didactic lectures on a particular topic, followed by hands-on lab activities. This last for two weeks. We cover the following topics. Week one: Reproducibility Basic R Subsetting Data Summarizing Data Cleaning Data Week two: Manipulation Data Visualization of Data Statistics Functions Course instruction lasts for 4 hours each day with breaks. During each session we cover one or two modules, which include didactic lectures led by an instructor and followed by hands-on lab exercises. We recommend having two instructors and one TA. We have the instructors split up the module lectures for the following reasons: to reduce instruction burden to allow learners the opportunity to ask chat questions during the course without slowing the rest of the course to allow the learners to have instructors with slightly different teaching styles/explanations For labs we provide learners with 3 options: A room led by one instructor who waits briefly for each question and then walks through the exercises A room led by one instructor who allows students time to work through all exercises and then students share their work and challenges with guidance and troubleshooting from the instructor A room where the teaching assistant helps those who need one-on-one support Topics covered in each week of the online course: Students have access to our website for course resources which includes lecture slides, lab exercises, cheatsheets to remind them about important functions, homework assignments, and additional resources. 1.6.2 Stage 2: Self-Directed Review and Project Planning In this stage, learners can complete homework problems for extra practice or watch recordings of the lectures and labs from the previous week. This stage also lasts at least a week. It also gives students time to digest what they learned and catch up on other work and personal responsibilities before the code-a-thon. Learners are also encouraged to find data and are given resources on where one can find public data, so that they can identify a research question for their project in the code-a-thon stage. Learners are provided with an example project and a project template R Markdown file. 1.6.3 Stage 3: Code-a-thon In the final stage of the short course, learners participate in a 3 day code-a-thon, which allows them to apply what they learned to a topic of interest, get peer and instructor in person assistance, ask more extensive questions, and learn about some more advanced topics in reproducibility and data ethics. See this code-a-thon schedule for more details. 1.7 Getting Started DaSEH materials are designed to be beginner friendly. Users can work through our materials with no prerequisite knowledge in programming, environmental health, public health, or statistics. However, the appropriate technology, software, and a basic familiarity with R Studio is helpful. This section will detail what learners and instructors will need to be able to jump into our resources. 1.7.1 Technical Requirements Our materials the R statistical programming language for data analysis. R is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux and can be downloaded from the The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). While there is no specific R version requirement, we recommend that instructors have all students use the same version (typically the most recent version of R). Additional R packages are also required including: tidyverse naniar janitor esquisse Cheatsheets detailing how to use common packages and functions are available at the RStudio website. Please note that to install R version 3.5 and higher you will need to have a web browser and a compatible operating system. See this link for more information. 1.7.2 RStudio To work with R, we recommend the RStudio Integrated Development Environment. RStudio includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. RStudio is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) or in a browser connected to RStudio Server. More information and program installation instruction are available at the RStudio website. For reproducible data analyses and easy publishing of reports and presentations, we recommend using RMarkdown. More information about RMarkdown is also available at the RStudio website. 1.7.3 GitHub DaSEH is hosted on GitHub. GitHub is a website and cloud service that enables developers to store, manage, and track changes to their code. DaSEH uses GitHub for both development and distribution purposes. Users have complete access to all materials through our DaSEH GitHub repository. The repository contains all the materials needed for the case study. This includes the slide files to be distributed to learners, data used in the examples (that aren’t installed in R otherwise), cheatsheets to remind learners of packages, homework and lab files, including both keys and raw files for learners. While experience with GitHub is not needed for users to access the materials, users can use GitHub to streamline download and modification of our resources. An introduction on how to get started with GitHub is available at Happy Git. 1.8 Website Our website has the following pages: An about page explaining what the course is for: https://daseh.org/index.html A page that links to a form for people to apply to the course: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpzjYQBuM2rpo4SMZL_H65PI6U0sR1lPDjMI-DG2MtSld-1A/viewform A page with information about how people can participate and what is required: https://daseh.org/logistics.html A schedule with all associate materials: https://daseh.org/materials_schedule.html Resources about where to find environmental health data: https://daseh.org/data.html Resources for extra learning and help: https://daseh.org/resources.html A help page for common issues, common errors, and how to change preferences in RStudio: https://daseh.org/help.html 1.9 Feedback We are continually working to improve the DaSEH resources to address learner and educator needs.

We would greatly appreciate you filling it out if you have the time! 2.2.4 Materials We have the following modules on various topics related to data science for environmental public health. Each one has lecture slides built using ioslides and as well as lab activities built using R Markdown. The rendered version of the slides, as well as the raw Rmd file are available on the website or our GitHub repository. In addition, the rendered and raw versions of the both the lab and the lab key are also available. We also include cheatsheets so that learners can review the functions that they learned that day. An Introduction to R This module includes the history of how R came to be and how it differs from other options like Python or Stata. It also includes how students should anticipate the experience of learning in the course and suggestions for how to learn. It also introduces jargon such as variable, row, column, object. This module does not have a lab associated with it. Basic R This module includes how to assign objects, how to create vectors, and how to perform simple calculations. The lab activity which is just an html webpage (as learners are not yet introduced to Rmd files) involves performing simple mathematical operations, assigning vectors, and checking the class and length of vectors. RStudio This module includes a tour of RStudio, how to write code that can be saved or how to write interactive code, for instance for installing a package where the user may have to answer questions. The lab activity involves knitting the Rmd file, running code chunks in the Rmd file, running all previous chunks, creating new chunks, and adding headers. Reproducibility This module introduces concepts related to repeatability, reproducibility, and replicability. It introduces best practices for improving transparency in our code. The lab activity features tasks like cleaning the environment, using the set.seed() function to generate the same random numbers each time, and using the sessionInfo() function to list packages and versions used. Data Input This module describes how to import data using point-and-click methods within RStudio as well as through using functions of the readr package. We cover import of csv files and other delimited files like tab delimited files, as well as tools for importing excel files and SAS, SPSS, and Stata files. We also cover methods for checking your imported data. The lab activity covers using the point-and-click option within RStudio and using code with readr. Data Subsetting This module includes information about how to access specific parts of our data that we are interested including using options to select for specific columns or filter for specific rows. In doing so we cover and and or logic for applying conditions for filtering. We also cover renaming columns (using rename from the dplyr package and clean_names from the janitor package) and best practices for naming columns, as this can impact our ability to subset our data. We also discuss why pulling the data withing a column of a data frame as a vector is often needed for mathematical operations. In addition we cover how to arrange data based on a specific order of interest, how to remove columns, and how to create columns using the mutate() function. The lab activity covers functions like rename(), rename_with(), pull(), select(), filter() so that learners can practice renaming columns, pulling out the vector version of columns, selecting specific columns, and filtering data based on thresholds or other conditions of specific columns. Learners also practice creating new columns with mutate(). Data Summarization This module covers how to apply mathematical functions to get summary statistics from data including, mean, standard deviation, range, max, and min. We show how we can pull the data out as a vector to use these functions or we can use the summarize() function on columns of a data to create a new data frame with summary statistics. We also talk about the summary() function to find quantiles of data quickly. In the lab activity, learners find the dimensions of the data, use the count function to summarize the data, use pull and mathematical functions like sum to calculate summaries of columns, as well as use the summarize() function to summarize the data. Data Cleaning This module covers how to find and work with missing data using the naniar package and count, how to recode missing data or recode data as NA, how to recode specific values of a column or create a new column based on conditions of other columns using the case_when() function. We also cover how to separate or unite columns and how to use stringr functions to help modify values or find specific values based on patterns within the values as opposed to perfect matches. In the lab activity, learners evaluate the missing data within a dataset and recode data within a dataset that has many different values for the same measurement. For example, “n, N, and”No” to indicate no exposure. Manipulating Data This module covers how to rearrange data so that it is either in long or wide format. We discuss how wide format can be useful for human interpretation and how long format is useful for R to use the data for analyses and data visualizations. We also discuss how to join different datasets together and describe why one might want to do this. In the lab activity, learners use functions like pivot_longer and pivot_wider to change the shape of a dataset. They also practice doing joins of datasets together and comparing how the different joining functions work. Intro to Data Visualization This module gives learners a taste of making data visualizations by using the point-and-click option of the esquisse package so that learners can quickly attempt data visualizations and get the code for generating such visualizations. In the lab activity, learners get to try out creating different plots with esquisse. Data Visualization This module dives deeper into best practices for data visualization, how to make a ggplot2 plot, and more customization options for creating data visualizations such as using themes, how to spot common issues in visualizations and fix them, as well as how to make plots interactive or how to combine plots using other packages like plotly and patchwork. In the lab activity, learners practice making plots directly with ggplot2 and practice applying new themes to their plots and faceting their plots. Factors In this module learners discover why factors are a unique type of data that requires special care to make summaries, data analysis results, and visualizations show data in the proper order. We show how to use the forecats package to reorder a factor variable based on the values of another variable. In the lab activity, learners convert a variable to a factor class and specify new levels for the variable. They also discover how this changes the order of the variable values within data summaries and plots, as compared to the data just being a categorical variable instead of a factor. Statistics In this module, we describe how statistical tests like t-tests, correlation, and regression are performed within R. We do not focus on the statistical interpretation, but rather how one can use R tools to perform statistical test and get the results. In the lab activity, learners perform a correlation test between two vectors, perform a t-test, and perform regressions (including a logistic regression). Data Output In this module, learners discover that they can save their processed data as RDS (R native) or csv files so that they don’t have to rerun processing on data (especially if it is large) or if they want to share data with others. In the lab activity, learners write a csv and RDS file as well as read back in an RDS file. Functions In this final module, learners discover the power of writing their own functions. They also learn about using the apply functions and across() function to apply the same function across different columns within a data frame. We discuss why using less repetitive code can improve the quality and efficiency of their code. In the lab activity, learners create their own simple functions and use the across function to summarize different columns of a dataset, as well as apply a new function on the specific columns of dataset. 2.3 DaSEH GitHub Organization GitHub is a website and cloud service that enables developers to store, manage, and track changes to their code. DaSEH uses GitHub for both development and distribution purposes. Users have complete access to all DaSEH course materials at our course and website repository. This diagram explains the folder structure of our materials: 2.4 Codeathon Resources In addition to the modules, we have resources available that are covered during our codeathon. This link also includes our introduction, conclusion slides, and slides about running standups to get people talking about their work. These include resources about: Version Control This resources discusses the basics of using GitHub/Git and R. It includes how to make a new repository, how to upload files to GitHub like data or code, how to set up usage of Git on your local computer, and how to push changes from your local computer to GitHub. Open Data This resource covers places to find data to perform environmental health data science research. Code Review This resource includes the basics of how to do code review on GitHub, include the use of GitHub issues. Data Ethics This covers information about AI use, data protection, data privacy, data provenance and more. Mapping mini-module This covers different tools available to make maps in R, the basics for making map plots, as well as tips and resources. 2.5 Data All of the data used in the modules are also included in the GitHub repository within the data folder. This data can be reused separately outside of our our module materials for other uses. To use the DaSEH data, you can either: Download the full DaSEH GitHub repository and find the data in the folder or directory called data. Directly download individual files by searching through our data directory on GitHub, clicking on a data file and the clicking the download raw file button. Information about the which modules the data is used in and information about the data sources can be found here: https://daseh.org/data.html. This page also includes other relevant datasets which can be used to develop or adapt course materials, such as for homework assignments, extra practice, or projects. 2.5.1 Adapting materials If you are interested in creating a similar website from our course materials or you want to take our lecture slides and adapt them, you can do either of the following: Download the full DaSEH GitHub repository and find the file ending in .Rmd in the folder or directory called Module to copy paste our code and slide comments.

Use the full set of DaSEH resources, some of the modules, or just the data for different kinds of instruction. Extend the materials to serve as a template for homework assignments or independent student exploration. The examples presented in this chapter are merely suggestions - modifications to the material to fit student needs are expected and encouraged! If you come up with a different way to use our resources, please let us know what you come up with so that other educators may be inspired by your creativity. 3.1.1 Prerequisites 3.1.1.1 Environmental Health Subject Matter The materials in DaSEH use data related to environmental health. There is no requirement for any prior knowledge on environmental health. The resources are also applicable for those interested in data science for other uses. 3.1.1.2 Statistics The DaSEH materials do expect some familiarity with statistics and focuses mostly on the application of R for analysis, rather than the theory of statistics. We recommend additional resources for statistics if you are teaching a statistics course. 3.1.1.3 Coding/Data Science All materials for DaSEH use the R statistical programming language for data analysis. No familiarity with R basics is expected for learners. 3.1.1.4 Software All case studies use the R statistical programming language for data analysis. While there is no specific R version requirement for the case studies, the OCSdata package, which can be used to get and load the data, does require R 3.5. Furthermore, R packages used to run specific analyses in each case study may have their own R version requirements. R version requirements may be checked in the sessionInfo() section in each case study. 3.1.2 Experience Level Descriptions The table below explains how we define the beginner, intermediate, and advanced experience levels. Experience Level Description Beginner Little to no previous experience with coding and/or statistical analysis. Intermediate Familiar with at least one programming language and has experience working with data and statistics. Advanced Fluent in at least one programming language and likely familiar with more. Has a depth of experience working with data science projects. Typically, most middle/high school and first year undergraduate students will fit in the beginner category. Upperclassmen undergraduates and some graduate students are often at the intermediate level. Most advanced level students will be at the graduate level. However, this is a generalization, and a student may be considered beginner, intermediate, or advanced at any academic level depending on their independent studies and experiences. 3.2 DaSEH in the Classroom The DaSEH materials are structured in a modular manner to support both partial and full use of our materials. Educators are also free to use the DaSEH data by itself. 3.2.1 Teaching the full set of materials The DaSEH materials are written to provide a comprehensive introduction to environmental health data science. Our materials provide students with experience in all the standard aspects of a data science workflow as well as best practices regarding reproducibility. The following list provides a few examples of how educators could use the materials: Use our full set of slides as lecture and materials as we have used them Do a flipped classroom approach and assigned students to read the slides as homework and do labs in the class together Assign students to extend analysis beyond what is shown in our lecture or lab materials to dive deeper or provide more homework 3.2.1.1 Duration DaSEH was designed to fit the duration of an intensive two week short course for 3.5 hours a day for roughly 32 hours of instruction time. However, the materials could also be spread out to fit a semester 16 week long course. 3.2.2 Teaching Part of the DaSEH Materials Some educators may find that only certain modules are relevant to their course learning objectives. Each provides information about how to access the appropriate data. Note that you may have to add some introduction to explain any functions that were explained in a previous module. For a data visualization course, the following modules could be useful: Basic R (only if students don’t have familiarity with R) RStudio (only if students don’t have familiarity with R) Manipulating Data in R (to convert data from wide to long format to facilitate data visualization) Intro to Data Visualization Data Visualization Factors For a data wrangling course, the following modules could be useful: Basic R RStudio (only if students don’t have familiarity with R) Subsetting Data in R Data Classes Data Cleaning Manipulating Data in R Factors For a reproducibility course the following modules could be useful: Reproducibility Data Input Data Output Functions For a data ethics course the following materials could be useful: Reproducibility Version Control (from the codeathon materials) Data ethics (from the codeathon materials) 3.2.3 Teaching With DaSEH Data Only Educators can use the data available with the DaSEH without using the DaSEH materials as a whole. The data is available on GitHub in the data directory. See the data section of the infrastructure chapter for more information about how to access the data. The data can also be accessed in R by updating the path of daseh.org/data/ with the name of the data file in the URL like the following examples: library(readr) er &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://daseh.org/data/CO_ER_heat_visits.csv&quot;) er_visits_age &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://daseh.org/data/CO_ER_heat_visits_by_age.csv&quot;) Denver_heat_Data.csv &lt;- (&quot;https://daseh.org/data/Denver_heat_data.csv&quot;) Be careful to make sure that the name of the file matches exactly include the case of the letters: A table of which data is used in which materials is available here: https://daseh.org/data.html 3.3 DaSEH Level Recommendations Overall the DaSEH materials are intended for anyone with zero to minimal familiarity with R, although we have had learners with more intermediate levels of experience who have reported getting a lot out of the material. Across the program, the modules also involve different levels of skill, as some would be fine on their own for beginners, while others may require some basic familiarity. Below we provide broad categorizations of each module in terms of the skill levels required (beginner, intermediate, or advanced). Here, we are using the following interpretations of “beginner”, “intermediate”, and “advanced”: Level Skills Beginner No experience with importing data into any programming language. No experience wrangling and cleaning raw data in any programming language. No experience visualizing data in any programming language. No experience with statistical concepts. Intermediate Some experience with importing common data formats (e.g. CSVs) into R or significant experience in another programming language. Some experience wrangling or cleaning raw data in common formats (e.g. numerical data) in R or significant experience in another programming language. Some experience with common visualization packages in R (e.g. ggplot) or significant experience in another programming language. Some familiarity with common statistical concepts (e.g. summary statistics, hypothesis testing) and techniques (e.g. t-test). Advanced Experience with importing uncommon data types (e.g. PDFs or web-scraping) and comfort with troubleshooting import challenges. Experience cleaning and wrangling raw data in uncommon formats (e.g. regular expressions) in R and comfort with troubleshooting wrangling challenges. Experience with creating complex data visualizations in R and comfort with visualization challenges.Good understanding of foundational statistical concepts and comfort with applying foundational statistical techniques. The following table lists a few example case studies that would be suitable for each experience level. Module Skill Level Intro Beginner Basic R Beginner RStudio Beginner Reproducibility Beginner but also appropriate for Intermediate or Advanced audiences that are new to this topic Data Input Beginner Subsetting Data in R Intermediate Data Summarization Intermediate Data Classes Beginner Data Cleaning Intermediate Manipulating Data in R Intermediate Intro to Data Visualization Beginner Data Visualization Intermediate Factors Intermediate Statistics Beginner * Note that we do not focus on statistical theory, but rather on using R to perform tests Data Output Beginner Functions Intermediate and Advanced if a new topic Version Control (codeathon resource) Intermediate and Advanced if a new topic Open Data Beginner Code Review All levels if new topic Data Ethics All levels Mapping mini-module Intermediate 3.4 Troubleshooting You may encounter errors trying to render our materials. R packages versions can have updates to arguments and function names that can cause code to work differently or can break the code. If you encounter an error, this is likely the reason. We try to update our materials when we can, but updates to packages may happen in the meantime. You can either use the error message from trying to knit the Rmd file to determine what function may have been updated or deprecated (we recommend this option to help you or your students learn the most up-to-date information). 3.5 Additional Use Cases Our materials can be used in a variety of ways that cater to the learner’s goals, experience, and interests. Below, we provide a few examples of how they could be used . If you use DaSEH resources in a new way, we would love to hear about it! Using materials for assignments Assignments could include: - Scientific writing like writing scientific journal sections (e.g. Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) based on the the data - Extending analyses based on results presented in the lectures and labs. - Additional data visualization - Presentations Our final project guidelines could also be expanded to create a more involved project. Independent Study Our materials and recordings be used for learners to gain experience in statistics and data science independently. We strongly recommend that independent learners aim to actively engage with the recordings by running the analyses independently, and exploring additional data to investigate their own hypotheses. Furthermore, creating a finished product, such as a blog post or a presentation, can be an excellent demonstration of the skills learned. 3.6 Additional Resources See here guidelines about considerations for effective and ethical data visualizations from the Advanced Data Science Course taught by Jeff leek and Roger Peng at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. We also include a resource for drafting and evaluating scientific writing here. 3.7 Session info ## R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libblas.so.3 ## LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.20.so; LAPACK version 3.10.0 ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8 ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## time zone: Etc/UTC ## tzcode source: system (glibc) ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] jsonlite_2.0.0 dplyr_1.1.4 compiler_4.3.2 gitcreds_0.1.2 ## [5] promises_1.2.1 tidyselect_1.2.0 Rcpp_1.0.12 webshot2_0.1.2 ## [9] xml2_1.5.1 stringr_1.5.1 tidyr_1.3.1 later_1.3.2 ## [13] jquerylib_0.1.4 yaml_2.3.12 fastmap_1.1.1 readr_2.1.5 ## [17] R6_2.6.1 generics_0.1.3 curl_7.0.0 knitr_1.50 ## [21] tibble_3.3.0 bookdown_0.46 rprojroot_2.1.1 tzdb_0.4.0 ## [25] bslib_0.6.1 pillar_1.9.0 rlang_1.1.6 utf8_1.2.4 ## [29] websocket_1.4.4 stringi_1.8.3 cachem_1.0.8 xfun_0.55 ## [33] sass_0.4.8 cli_3.6.5 magrittr_2.0.3 ps_1.9.1 ## [37] digest_0.6.34 rvest_1.0.5 processx_3.8.6 hms_1.1.3 ## [41] lifecycle_1.0.4 chromote_0.5.1 vctrs_0.6.5 ottrpal_2.0.0 ## [45] evaluate_1.0.5 glue_1.7.0 spelling_2.3.2 fansi_1.0.6 ## [49] purrr_1.0.2 rmarkdown_2.25 httr_1.4.7 tools_4.3.2 ## [53] pkgconfig_2.0.3 htmltools_0.5.7 "],["modifying-daseh-materials.html", "Chapter 4 Modifying DaSEH Materials 4.1 Learning Objectives 4.2 Modify the website 4.3 Modify module slides 4.4 Modifying Labs 4.5 Modify Codeathon materials 4.6 Distribute your modified content as you please! 4.7 Session info", " Chapter 4 Modifying DaSEH Materials 4.1 Learning Objectives This chapter will cover how to modify the DaSEH resources to suit your own needs using the following methods: Modify the website Modify module lecture slides Modify module labs and lab keys Modify codeathon resources 4.2 Modify the website If you would like to make a copy of our website to modify for your own use, there are a couple of options. You can “fork” our repository so that you can keep track of changes that we make and send us suggestions if you’d like. This also allows you to use the same infrastructure that we did to create our website. Please be sure to update the website so that it is clear who ultimately made your site and please indicate that you are using our resources or a modified version of our resources. You can copy the files from our repository into your own website - to access the contents of the files, go to our repository on GitHub. This allows you to use whatever website setup you would like. 4.2.1 Creating a fork of our repository To create what is called a “fork” of our repository (which allows you to make your own version based off of ours) then look for the fork button on the upper right corner of our repository on GitHub. Once you click this, you will be taken to a new page where it will ask you what you would like to call your new repository. You will likely want to change the name for your course/use. You can also optionally select to have your repository as part of a GitHub organization (if you are part of one) instead of just using your personal account. Please also change the description to explain what your use is and that are modifying our files. Ensure that the copy the main branch only is selected. Then click the green “Create fork” button. Here is what the page looks like: Next to set up the website deployment you will need to do a few steps. Setting up the website First go to the “Settings” page (top menu) Then scroll down to the “Pages” (on the left menu) Next configure your website to use the main branch (where it says “none”) and the root folder and press save Create a secret (to give you the right permissions) This allows you to run the GitHub actions that we use safely. Click on your profile photo in the upper right corner Scroll down to Settings in the menu that pops up and right click to open it in a new tab Scroll all the way down on the left menu to the bottom where it says Developer Settings Score down on the left side menu and click on Personal Access Tokens Select Tokens (classic) Click the Generate new token button that is in the upper right Select Generate new token (classic) Confirm your access with any two factor authentication if you have that set up Name your token GH_PAT in the “Note” section Note that your token will expire based on the date that you set in the Expiration section. You will have to complete this process again when your token expires. GitHub will let you know as you will get an error about credentials. It is a good idea to use the default settings. You will just repeat this process when the time comes. This cheatsheet may also be helpful. Underneath Select Scopes (where the check boxes are), check repository (so everything under it is checked) and workflow Click the green Generate Token button at the bottom Copy your personal access token (Note that you will note have access to it again, you can always however just make a new one. Do not store it anywhere public.) Add your secret to your repository Now that your secret is ready we will add it back to our website repository that we created from the DaSEH repository. Go to Settings at the top menu of your repository Go to Secrets and variables in the left side menu Click on Actions Under Repository secrets, click on the green “New repository secrets” button Under name, enter GH_PAT For the secret section paste the secret that you copied Click the green “Add secret” button. Note that GitHub sometimes changes their website, so this process might slightly change. We will try to keep this information up-to-date however. Nice! Now you are ready to modify your new website. You can find your rendered website under the repository settings tab (top menu) and scrolling down to pages (left menu) again. You will see that the page now lists a link for your new website. You can click “Visit site” to see your website or copy and paste the link. This is the link you can share with students/learners. Currently your website should look exactly like ours. Now you are ready to actually modify some files. To do so go to the main page of your repository. You can either click the green code button to clone the repository to work on your local machine (say on RStudio) which is trickier but recommended as you can actually test any changes to your code on your machine or you can modify the files directly on GitHub. Please see this guide on how to make changes with either method: https://www.ottrproject.org/editing_website.html. Note that lecture slides and lab files will be within the modules folder and organized by topic. We will now talk about how to modify these files. 4.3 Modify module slides The modules are written in R Markdown documents and developed within an RStudio project. R Markdown documents are denoted with the file extension “.Rmd” and allow for the inclusion of code chunks and outputs in a written report. They are written using Markdown syntax. RStudio projects are used to organize files. The knitr package “knits” the case study written in R Markdown and outputs the document as an HTML file. DaSEH uses these HTML files to post the materials online. See the above sections about modifying the website to get the files that were used for the module lectures. Each of the lectures can be found within the modules directory of our DaSEH GitHub repository. Each module folder contains the lecture slides within the .Rmd file. To edit a lecture, locate the appropriate directory within modules and edit the .Rmd file. For example, if you want to edit the Statistics lecture, you’d edit Statistics.Rmd in the modules/Statistics/ directory. ** Do not edit the html or pdf files. These are automatically generated by GitHub Actions. ** However, sometimes workflows don’t complete, so it’s always good to double check that htmls and pdfs are appearing as expected on the website once your PR is merged to main. You will notice that ## is used throughout the file. This indicates where the start of a new slide is. A single # indicates a new section slide, which will be a slide that looks like this: 4.3.1 Emojis in slides We recommend copying and pasting from here. 4.3.2 Smaller text font per slide If you want to change the style of a slide, modify the style.css file. For example - this is how you can make slides with smaller font: In the style .css file is the following- which creates smaller font: .small { font-size: 0.8em; } To change the font of a single slide you can putt {.small} next to a slide title like so: ## slide name {.small} 4.3.3 Smaller code font per slide In the style .css file is the following- which creates smaller font: .codesmall pre { font-size: 16px; } This can be applied to a slide by putting {.codesmall} next to a slide title like so: ## slide name {.codesmall} 4.3.4 Add color to slide text :::{style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&quot;} RED STUFF! ::: or like this: Integer is a special subset of numeric that contains only whole numbers. 4.3.5 Add background color to code chunk describe general syntax for code In the styles.css file is the following: .codeexample pre{ background-color: lightgreen; } To add this to a chunk use this in the Rmd file before and after the chunk: &lt;div class = &quot;codeexample&quot;&gt; ``` r #some code ``` &lt;/div&gt; 4.3.6 Create gifs To create video gifs first record your screen like so (note this is for Mac users): Command + Shift + 5 Select either entire screen - or more likely a portion of the screen button Click record Next convert the video to a gif using https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif. Be sure that you select gif as the output. These slides are made with something called ioslides. See [this website for additional help with ioslides] (https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html). 4.4 Modifying Labs Within each module directory, there is a subdirectory called lab. Locate the lab subdirectory within the appropriate module directory and edit the _Key.Rmd file. For example, if you want to edit the Statistics lab, you’d edit Statistics_Lab_Key.Rmd in the modules/Statistics/lab/ directory. ** Only edit the _Key.Rmd. Do not edit the html or pdf files, or the _Lab.Rmd file. These are automatically generated by GitHub Actions. ** The _Lab.Rmd file is automatically cleaned up for students to fill in during class. 4.4.0.1 How does the lab file cleanup work? When creating the lab key, you will write the answer to the questions in the key. However, for the file that the students see, we want the answers to be removed. To make sure this happens correctly, the chunks you want to clean must have a label ending with response. Chunks without a label following this pattern will be ignored and reproduced exactly for the students. 4.4.0.2 Manually Download Data from GitHub: Download the .Rmd files found in the modules directory of the GitHub repository (and any relevant data files from the data directory). The list of corresponding lectures is available on the materials and schedule page of the DaSEH website and the data files are listed on our data page. Move the data files from your ‘Downloads’ folder to your R session’s current working directory (you can see what this is with getwd()). Open the files that you wish to modify in RStudio or wherever you like to work. 4.5 Modify Codeathon materials Our codeathon materials are Google Slide presentations which are available to view by the public. This allows for copying and pasting content within the slides. If you would like access to the raw slides, please reach out to us at daseh@fredhutch.org. 4.6 Distribute your modified content as you please! You can share HTML, PDF and Word files directly with your students or you can host your website for free on GitHub using GitHub pages (pages_github?) as described above. If you are new to GitHub, also be sure to check out Happy Git with R (happygitwithr?). 4.7 Session info ## R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libblas.so.3 ## LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.20.so; LAPACK version 3.10.0 ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8 ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## time zone: Etc/UTC ## tzcode source: system (glibc) ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] jsonlite_2.0.0 dplyr_1.1.4 compiler_4.3.2 gitcreds_0.1.2 ## [5] promises_1.2.1 tidyselect_1.2.0 Rcpp_1.0.12 webshot2_0.1.2 ## [9] xml2_1.5.1 stringr_1.5.1 tidyr_1.3.1 later_1.3.2 ## [13] jquerylib_0.1.4 yaml_2.3.12 fastmap_1.1.1 readr_2.1.5 ## [17] R6_2.6.1 generics_0.1.3 curl_7.0.0 knitr_1.50 ## [21] tibble_3.3.0 bookdown_0.46 rprojroot_2.1.1 tzdb_0.4.0 ## [25] bslib_0.6.1 pillar_1.9.0 rlang_1.1.6 utf8_1.2.4 ## [29] websocket_1.4.4 stringi_1.8.3 cachem_1.0.8 xfun_0.55 ## [33] sass_0.4.8 cli_3.6.5 magrittr_2.0.3 ps_1.9.1 ## [37] digest_0.6.34 rvest_1.0.5 processx_3.8.6 hms_1.1.3 ## [41] lifecycle_1.0.4 chromote_0.5.1 vctrs_0.6.5 ottrpal_2.0.0 ## [45] evaluate_1.0.5 glue_1.7.0 spelling_2.3.2 fansi_1.0.6 ## [49] purrr_1.0.2 rmarkdown_2.25 httr_1.4.7 tools_4.3.2 ## [53] pkgconfig_2.0.3 htmltools_0.5.7 "],["running-a-program-like-daseh.html", "Chapter 5 Running a program like DaSEH 5.1 Learning Objectives 5.2 Planning a short course 5.3 Tips for codeathons 5.4 Session info", " Chapter 5 Running a program like DaSEH 5.1 Learning Objectives In this chapter we will discuss how to: -
